name: On PR approved for DATA_PRODUCT, call a reusable workflow


# DDL scripts must be executed sequentially via Schemachange when using Versioned Script Naming.
# The workflow is expected to trigger in two scenarios:
# 1. When a pull request is created
# 2. When it is approved and changes are pushed to the master branch
# The intent is to ensure that, upon pull request creation, the workflow verifies that 
# the DDL statements can be executed in the Snowflake database without errors prior to PR approval.
